An experimental WordPress theme that is AMP ready without any plugins.

== Description ==

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/emrikol/volt.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/emrikol/volt)

I've made it a personal challenge to create an [AMP](https://www.ampproject.org/) compatible theme without any plugins, supporting as many [Jetpack](https://jetpack.com/) features as possible.

== Installation ==

1. In your admin panel, go to Appearance > Themes and click the Add New button.
2. Click Upload and Choose File, then select the theme's .zip file. Click Install Now.
3. Click Activate to use your new theme right away.
